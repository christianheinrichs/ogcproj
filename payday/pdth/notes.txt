Render settings:

XML section d3d_device:
- GPU adapter: adapter = "{string}"
- Adapter index: adapter_index = "{integer}"
- Resolution: resolution = "{width integer} {height integer}"
- Fullscreen: windowed = "{boolean}"
  - Enabled: false
  - Disabled: true
- Monitor refresh rate: refresh_rate = "{integer}"
- Aspect ratio: aspect_ratio = "{float}"
  - Instead of using the {integer}:{integer} format, float values are used:
    - 4:3 = 1.33333
    - 5:4 = 1.25
    - 16:9 = 1.77778
- Vertical synchronisation: v_sync = "{boolean integer}"
  - Enabled: 1
  - Disabled: 0

XML section render_settings:
- Anisotropic filtering: max_anisotropy = "{integer}"
  - Off: 1
  - 2x: 2
  - 4x: 4
  - 8x: 8
  - 16x: 16
- Texture quality: texture_quality_default = "{string}"
  - Very low: very low
  - Low: low
  - Medium: medium
  - High: high

Unfortunately, the rest of the settings is saved in what I can only assume is a
binary format with the .sav file ending. To be more precise, the file in
question is save000.sav. So there is no reason to add the save000.sav file to
the open game configuration project.

A local cloud save copy of the mentioned file is saved in:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\{steamuserid}\24240\remote
